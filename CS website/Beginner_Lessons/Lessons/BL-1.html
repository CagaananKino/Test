					<h1> Equal Thickness </h1>
					<p style="font-size: 20pt"> One of the most easiest ways of line

				<div class="ExplainN-1">
		
					<h1> Weighted Thickness </h1>
					<p style="font-size: 20pt"> This is the use of variance of lines In
					a given stroke, This can create a lively character and a smooth one
					,shown like inside the example down below. <p>
					<img style="width: 400px; height: 400px" src="../../Images/BL-1_Images/1Showcase4-2.png">

					<h1> Dynamic Thickness </h1>
					<p style="font-size: 20pt"> These are weighted lines with purpose!
